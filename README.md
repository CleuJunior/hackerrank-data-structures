# HackerRank Data Structures
This repository contains my solutions to the data structure problems in the HackerRank platform's "Data Structures" section. The problems are categorized based on different data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

## Problem Solving Approach
For each problem, I have implemented a solution in java. The solutions are organized in folders based on the data structure category. Each folder contains the problem description, the solution code, and any additional helper functions or classes that were used.
